Shuhuai Ren, Yihe Deng, Kun He, Wanxiang Che__<br>\n","Based on the synonyms substitution strategy, they introduced a new word replacement order determined by both the word saliency and the classification probability, and propose a greedy algorithm called probability weighted word saliency (PWWS) for text adversarial attack.\n","- __TextFoolerJin2019 - Is BERT Really Robust? A Strong Baseline for Natural Language Attack on Text Classification and Entailment.__<br>\n","In this paper, we present TextFooler, a simple but strong baseline to generate natural adversarial text. By applying it to two fundamental natural language tasks, text classification and textual entailment, we successfully attacked three target models, including the powerful pre-trained BERT, and the widely used convolutional and recurrent neural networks. We demonstrate the advantages of this framework in three ways: (1) effective---it outperforms state-of-the-art attacks in terms of success rate and perturbation rate, (2) utility-preserving---it preserves semantic content and grammaticality, and remains correctly classified by humans, and (3) efficient---it generates adversarial text with computational complexity linear to the text length. *The code, pre-trained target models, and test examples are available at https://github.com/jind11/TextFooler.\n","- __BAEGarg2019-BAE (BAE: BERT-Based Adversarial Examples)__ <br>\n","BAE, a black box attack for generating adversarial examples using contextual perturbations from a BERT masked language model. BAE replaces and inserts tokens in the original text by masking a portion of the text and leveraging the BERT-MLM to generate alternatives for the masked tokens. Through automatic and human evaluations, we show that BAE performs a stronger attack, in addition to generating adversarial examples with improved grammaticality and semantic coherence as compared to prior work.\n","- __BERTAttackLi2020 - BERT-ATTACK: Adversarial Attack Against BERT Using BERT.__ <br>\n","we propose \\textbf{BERT-Attack}, a high-quality and effective method to generate adversarial samples using pre-trained masked language models exemplified by BERT. We turn BERT against its fine-tuned models and other deep neural models for downstream tasks. Our method successfully misleads the target models to predict incorrectly, outperforming state-of-the-art attack strategies in both success rate and perturb percentage, while the generated adversarial samples are fluent and semantically preserved. Also, the cost of calculation is low, thus possible for large-scale generations.\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"PrbS2Z-H3sQs","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1627706389534,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":230,"user":{"displayName":"Bhupender saini","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GjW1nYjUjrI6fSCoD9rs8R5pgZbi6VAk4jGbR0NYA=s64","userId":"10265617276189948004"}},"outputId":"5710e3ae-c9c8-4ac3-cd90-7f5878904043"},"source":["'''\n","Some of the attack recipe provided by textattack is not working with lengthy article.
