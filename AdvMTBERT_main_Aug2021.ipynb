TextFooler\n","__TextFoolerJin2019 - Is BERT Really Robust? A Strong Baseline for Natural Language Attack on Text Classification and Entailment.__<br>\n","In this paper, we present TextFooler, a simple but strong baseline to generate natural adversarial text. By applying it to two fundamental natural language tasks, text classification and textual entailment, we successfully attacked three target models, including the powerful pre-trained BERT, and the widely used convolutional and recurrent neural networks. We demonstrate the advantages of this framework in three ways: (1) effective---it outperforms state-of-the-art attacks in terms of success rate and perturbation rate, (2) utility-preserving---it preserves semantic content and grammaticality, and remains correctly classified by humans, and (3) efficient---it generates adversarial text with computational complexity linear to the text length.

TextBugger\n","__TextBugger: Generating Adversarial Text Against Real-world Applications.__ <br>\n","Deep Learning-based Text Understanding (DLTU) is the backbone technique behind various applications, including question answering, machine translation, and text classification. Despite its tremendous popularity, the security vulnerabilities of DLTU are still largely unknown, which is highly concerning given its increasing use in security-sensitive applications such as sentiment analysis and toxic content detection. In this paper, we show that DLTU is inherently vulnerable to adversarial text attacks, in which maliciously crafted texts trigger target DLTU systems and services to misbehave. Specifically, we present TextBugger, a general attack framework for generating adversarial texts. In contrast to prior works, TextBugger differs in significant ways: (i) effective -- it outperforms state-of-the-art attacks in terms of attack success rate; (ii) evasive -- it preserves the utility of benign text, with 94.9\\% of the adversarial text correctly recognized by human readers; and (iii) efficient -- it generates adversarial text with computational complexity sub-linear to the text length. We empirically evaluate TextBugger on a set of real-world DLTU systems and services used for sentiment analysis and toxic content detection, demonstrating its effectiveness, evasiveness, and efficiency. For instance, TextBugger achieves 100\\% success rate on the IMDB dataset based on Amazon AWS Comprehend within 4.61 seconds and preserves 97\\% semantic similarity. We further discuss possible defense mechanisms to mitigate such attack and the adversary's potential countermeasures, which leads to promising directions for further research.\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":69},"id":"Hsg_JPKG-lKI","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1637261481401,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":24,"user":{"displayName":"Bhupender

We turn BERT against its fine-tuned models and other deep neural models for downstream tasks. Our method successfully misleads the target models to predict incorrectly, outperforming state-of-the-art attack strategies in both success rate and perturb percentage, while the generated adversarial samples are fluent and semantically preserved.
